# Customer-Value-Lifetime

## Dataset Overview

This project uses the **Online Retail II dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**, a large real-world e-commerce transaction dataset that is widely used for data science and time series analysis tasks.

The dataset contains transactional data generated by a **UK-based, non-store online retailer** that primarily sells unique all-occasion giftware.

Each row in the dataset corresponds to a **single product item within an invoice**, and includes the following key fields:

- **InvoiceNo**: Unique identifier for each invoice (invoices starting with `C` indicate cancellations)
- **StockCode**: Unique identifier for each product
- **Description**: Product description
- **Quantity**: Number of units purchased (negative values indicate returns)
- **InvoiceDate**: Date and time at which the transaction occurred
- **UnitPrice**: Price per unit in British pounds (£)
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Country**: Country where the customer resides

Because the data records **individual transactions with timestamps**, it is inherently **event-based** rather than regularly sampled. This makes it particularly well suited for:
- **Time series aggregation and forecasting**
- **Customer behavior and lifetime value analysis**
- **Demand and seasonality analysis**
- **Anomaly and event detection**
- **Feature engineering for machine learning models**

In this project, the raw transaction data is transformed into **regularly sampled time series** (e.g. daily or weekly aggregates) to enable statistical modelling and forecasting.
